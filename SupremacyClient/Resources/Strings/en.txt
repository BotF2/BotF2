[OFFICERS_DESCRIPTION]
This refers to fleet officers.  They are responsible for commanding your starships and bases.  It is essential to have sufficient manpower to sustain your military operations.

[INTERNAL_AFFAIRS_DESCRIPTION]
This refers to your internal Morale strength.  A portion of available personnel will be assigned to this area, and be responsible for controlling a manageable morale level throughout the empire.  A low strength for instance could mean your current morale strength is more susceptible to fluctuation, via propaganda campaigns by rival empires, as well as other morale sapping events (such as losses of battles, breaking of treaties).  A very high strength could result in a stable morale even after a catastrophe, or subversive action by your forces (such as an invasion of an enemy system).

[EXTERNAL_AFFAIRS_DESCRIPTION]
External Affairs involves the smooth diplomatic relations with other powers and minor races.  A low strength in this area could result in less diplomatic effectiveness when conducting treaty negotiations, or persuading a minor race to join you (regardless of bribe figure).  A high strength could yield significant successes in the diplomatic arena, such as negotiating for Peace Treaties/Friendship Treaties etc, as well as sustaining more favourable sympathy ratings towards you with the other races.

[RA_NAME_BASIC_BIOTECH]
Basic Bio-Tech

[RA_DESC_BASIC_BIOTECH]
Biotech represents sophistication in life sciences such as biology and physiology, but also geology, meteorology and other planetary sciences. Terraforming and farming are affected by this field of science and technology.

[RA_NAME_HYDROPONICS]
Hydroponics

[RA_DESC_HYDROPONICS]
Hydroponics allows plants to grow in completely controlled environments based mostly on water. This includes the possibility of cultivating agricultural products aboard starships, on alien worlds, or even subterranean habitats.

[RA_NAME_BIOSYNTHETICS]
Bio-Synthetics

[RA_DESC_BIOSYNTHETICS]
Bio-synthetics describes the complex bio-manipulation of organic compounds, without disturbing or affecting the fundamental genetic structure. One simple compound can now be modified to synthetically mimic another more complex compound, effectively increasing the economic availability of many biological products.

[RA_NAME_BIONICS]
Bionics

[RA_DESC_BIONICS]
Bionics are synthetic tissues which replace organics. Bionic tissues can be used to repair injuries, strengthen fragile tissues, and in aid in surgical procedures.

[RA_NAME_PROTOMATTER]
Protomatter

[RA_DESC_PROTOMATTER]
Protomatter is a highly advanced bio-synthetic substance. Its benefit to the terraforming process cannot be understated. Protomatter has potentially many further field applications to today's science, although it remains to be seen how stable the translation matrix will prove to be, even under highly controlled conditions.

[RA_NAME_BIOREPLICATION]
Bio-Replication

[RA_DESC_BIOREPLICATION]
New plasma power sources have granted scientists access to this exciting bio-technology, which makes it possible to artificially replicate more advanced biological compounds. Not only does this technology have uses in medical fields, it could be a boon for the agricultural industry, as the technology could be used to create advanced new fertilisers; highly-specific, non-persistant chemical pesticides; and new methods for improving crop yields and vitality. The technology could even be used to create 'virtual food', which could supplement existing food supplies in times of need.

[RA_NAME_METAGENICS]
Metagenics

[RA_DESC_METAGENICS]
Metagenic technology allows scientists to create proto-genetic matter, which can breathe new life into barren ecologies. With the enhancement and further stabilization of existing protomatter matrices, it could yield startling results in rapid, large-scale terraforming projects.

[RA_NAME_CLIMATE_CONTROL]
Climate Control

[RA_DESC_CLIMATE_CONTROL]
Climate control allows the weather patterns of an entire planet to be controlled, by harnessing and redirecting solar radiation and air pressure. This technology has immediate applications in both terraforming and farming methods.

[RA_NAME_ATMOSPHERIC_CONVERSION]
Atmospheric Conversion

[RA_DESC_ATMOSPHERIC_CONVERSION]
Atmospheric conversion allows for the development of machines which can change the pressure and composition of alien atmospheres. These devices can make the airborne gases of an alien world more suitable for farms and colonists.

[RA_NAME_BIOFILTRATION]
Biofiltration

[RA_DESC_BIOFILTRATION]
Advances in genetics research make it possible to predict the expression of viral and bacterial specimens by direct analysis. Using this technology, biofilters can identify and eliminate harmful viral and bacterial agents in living organic tissues.

[RA_NAME_ECOMODIFICATION]
Eco-Modification

[RA_DESC_ECOMODIFICATION]
New research in planetary ecology has provided a greater understanding of the functions of planets as whole entities. Using this understanding terraformers can now streamline their efforts on alien worlds.

[RA_NAME_XENOBIOLOGY]
Xenobiology

[RA_DESC_XENOBIOLOGY]
Life on alien worlds frequently evolves differently from familiar lifeforms. Investigation into exotic alien lifeforms has led to a renewed understanding of the power of carbon-based genetics, and fantastic advances in bio-engineering.

[RA_NAME_SILICOBIOLOGY]
Silicobiology

[RA_DESC_SILICOBIOLOGY]
A comparative study of lifeforms based on elements other than carbon (such as silicon) is the key to understanding the nature of life itself.

[RA_NAME_BASIC_ENERGY]
Basic Energy

[RA_DESC_BASIC_ENERGY]
Energy technology represents the advances in generation and control of power. Its most direct benefit is in advanced power generation, but it also determines the strength and regenerative abilities of starship shields.

[RA_NAME_COLD_FUSION]
Cold Fusion

[RA_DESC_COLD_FUSION]
Advanced methods in the generation of fusion have heralded a new era in power generation and management. One of the most efficient and powerful forms of fusion is hydrogen fusion, whereby two atoms of deuterium are fused into helium. This reaction is used in fusion reactors.

[RA_NAME_SUBSPACE_PHYSICS]
Subspace Physics

[RA_DESC_SUBSPACE_PHYSICS]
Through acceleration, normal electromagnetic waves can be pushed over the subspace threshold. As a result, the behaviour of energy in subspace bands can now be predicted and exploited.

[RA_NAME_MATTER_CONVERSION]
Matter Conversion

[RA_DESC_MATTER_CONVERSION]
Matter conversion allows matter to be converted directly to energy, and vice versa. With powerful imaging scanners, it is conceivable that materialization could be patterned on the molecular or even the quantum level.

[RA_NAME_EP_DISTRIBUTION]
EP Distribution

[RA_DESC_EP_DISTRIBUTION]
Advanced theories in plasma physics now afford scientists even greater control in plasma management. Matter in the plasma state can normally reach temperatures of over 3 million Kelvin. Now this high-energy plasma, 'electro-plasma', can be harnessed and manipulated with force fields and magnetic containment, allowing for much safer and more efficient distribution.

[RA_NAME_SUBNUCLEONICS]
Subnucleonics

[RA_DESC_SUBNUCLEONICS]
With the development of highly accurate measuring systems for quantum decay rates, nucleonic behavioural probability can be analyzed. This ability will grant us with more efficient methods of plasma generation, its management, and its eventual distribution as a power source.

[RA_NAME_ANTIMATTER_FUSION]
Antimatter Fusion

[RA_DESC_ANTIMATTER_FUSION]
With advanced containment procedures, antimatter can be fused into larger nuclei than the anti-hydrogen that is commonly used as a reactant. These larger anti-nuclei produce more energy per reaction and simultaneously require less containment energy, allowing for the development of more efficient containment devices.

[RA_NAME_VIRTUAL_PARTICLES]
Virtual Particles

[RA_DESC_VIRTUAL_PARTICLES]
Many advanced technologies are dependent on exotic nuclear and chemical compounds. This revolutionary technology allows the creation of 'virtual particles' which simulate the presence of such compounds.

[RA_NAME_ULTRACONDUCTORS]
Ultraconductors

[RA_DESC_ULTRACONDUCTORS]
A quantified theory regarding the physical properties which allow ultraconductive materials to exist and function. Ultraconductive materials have a negative effective resistance; they actually add energy to a current which runs through them.

[RA_NAME_WAVE_ANALYSIS]
Wave Analysis

[RA_DESC_WAVE_ANALYSIS]
All matter is energy, and all energy exists as probabilistic waves. Therefore, everything in the universe is ultimately a wave function. Wave function analysis is the direct observation of these waves; it provides insight into even the most mysterious processes in the universe.

[RA_NAME_ZERO_POINT_ENERGY]
Zero Point Energy

[RA_DESC_ZERO_POINT_ENERGY]
Zero-point-energy involves the quantization of atomic energy levels, and the constraints placed upon energy and position by the uncertainty principle; effectively it is impossible for a confined particle to have zero energy. Consequently, the lowest energy a particle can have is finite.

Determinacy

[RA_DESC_DETERMINACY]
Quantum determinacy allows physicists to force an event to occur as long as its quantum probability is above a certain threshold. As this technology is explored, the necessary threshold of probability will approach zero.

[RA_NAME_TRANSPHASICS]
Transphasics

[RA_DESC_TRANSPHASICS]
Transphasic energy involves a highly unstable matrix of energetic anti-neutrinos. When normal neutrinos are exposed to a field of anti-neutrinos, phased at variable nutation ratios, an exponential energy increase is observed. The applications of this technology are vast, from general power generation, to weaponry and even 'stellarforming' (altering and modifying the nuclear forces within stars themselves).

This advanced application of molecular data imaging allows data to be stored in stable, solid-state crystal matrices which virtually eliminate the seek time delays of older fixed-bit crystal memory systems.

[RA_NAME_QUADRITRONICS]
Quadritronics

[RA_DESC_QUADRITRONICS]
Modern interphasic stabilizers allow the familiar duotron to be augmented by two more electrons in a perpendicular phase axis. The resulting unit is known as a 'quadritron', which has led to the use of the term 'quad' as a unit of data.

[RA_NAME_ISOLINEAR_OPTICS]
Isolinear Optics

[RA_DESC_ISOLINEAR_OPTICS]
Isolinear optics, when used with specially designed computer chips, allow instantaneous access to solid matter data-forms. Data retrieval and storage networks based on this technology will render older crystal memory devices utterly obsolete. Future starship designs will likely rely on optical data networks based on this technology, to quickly and efficiently relay virtually any form of data.

[RA_NAME_VARIABLE_FLOW_FIELD]
Variable Flow Field

[RA_DESC_VARIABLE_FLOW_FIELD]

Bio-Neural Circuitry

[RA_DESC_BIONEURAL_CIRCUITRY]
Isolinear systems have been enhanced and augmented with bio-neural circuitry. These devices employ an organic gelatinous solution of synthetic neural cells, which when used in data management and transfer, greatly improve speed and processing efficiency.

[RA_NAME_POSITRONICS]
Positronics

[RA_DESC_POSITRONICS]
The artificial self-awareness demonstrated by large scale quadritronic computers is apparently inherent to even the smallest positronic unit. These computers appear capable of self-design and self-programming; they learn and adapt to repeated tasks, constantly improving their own performance.

[RA_NAME_ULTRACONDUCTION]
Ultraconduction

[RA_DESC_ULTRACONDUCTION]
When exposed to a current, ultraconductive circuit elements add electromagnetic energy to the current, and thus have an effectively negative resistance. This results in a significant reduction in power requirements for large scale computer cores.

[RA_NAME_BASIC_PROPULSION]
Basic Propulsion

[RA_DESC_BASIC_PROPULSION]
Propulsion is the science which makes things move faster. Advances in propulsion make starships go faster and further, through gradual improvements in efficiency, thrust capacity, and thrust control.

[RA_NAME_DISTORTION]
Distortion

[RA_DESC_DISTORTION]
The first drive system to significantly exceed the speed of light, this system can propel a starship at true warp velocities. It functions by reshaping subspace around the drive system, essentially pulling the destination closer, whilst pushing the point of origin further away.

[RA_NAME_DILITHIUM_BONDING]
Dilithium Bonding

[RA_DESC_DILITHIUM_BONDING]
It is now possible to physically manipulate and recomposite dilithium crystals at the molecular level whilst the drive chamber is engaged. This ability allows the crystals to be specifically tailored ahead of the next antimatter infusion pulse. This ability will have many tangible benefits, including increased safety, greater power output, finer field control, and reduced field wastage.

[RA_NAME_PLASMA_INJECTION]
Plasma Injection

[RA_DESC_PLASMA_INJECTION]
Plasma injection involves powering warp field coils in short, energetic bursts. This method provides more power than older coil activation techniques, with better fine control over the shape and intensity of warp fields. It also reduces the stress put on the coils when the drive is engaged over long periods of time, allowing high warp velocities to be safely maintained for longer periods of time during emergency situations.

[RA_NAME_TRANSWARP]
Transwarp

[RA_DESC_TRANSWARP]
Transwarp is a new theory in warp science, involving speeds that could theoretically exceed those of conventional warp physics. Resonating an harmonic graviton pulse, an asynchronous, multilayered warp field can be created. The resulting subspace field can be manipulated indefinitely, and infinite speeds are possible. It is unlikely such great breakthroughs are close, but research in this field promises to endow current warp technologies with new insight.

[RA_NAME_FIELD_MANIPULATION]
Field Manipulation

[RA_DESC_FIELD_MANIPULATION]
Instead of generating a single immense warp field, this technology allows warp nacelle coils to create multiple, layered fields, which have a much greater cumulative effect. This reduces the overall power requirements of large warp fields.

[RA_NAME_FIELD_GEOMETRY]
Field Geometry

[RA_DESC_FIELD_GEOMETRY]
Warp field geometry allows engineers to control the shape of the warp fields, effectively reducing the field size needed by larger vessels. The design of future starships will be dictated by advances in this field.

[RA_NAME_SUPERCONDUCTORS]
Superconductors

[RA_DESC_SUPERCONDUCTORS]
Superconductors field containers allowing dilithium reactors and fuel storage cells to contain greater reactive mass. These improvements allow a significant increase in the productive capacity of warp cores.

[RA_NAME_FIELD_COMPRESSION]
Field Compression

[RA_DESC_FIELD_COMPRESSION]
An application of warp field geometry, this technology allows warp fields to be compressed into narrower ellipses. This permits greater conformity to the shape of the vessels they propel, eliminating wasted subspace distortion.

[RA_NAME_CHARGE_REVERSAL]
Charge Reversal

[RA_DESC_CHARGE_REVERSAL]

[RA_NAME_QUANTUM_CURVATURE]
Quantum Curvature

[RA_DESC_QUANTUM_CURVATURE]
Quantum curvature deals with the manipulation and modification of the fabric of the space-time continuum at the quantum level. The subspace resonance of the surrounding warp fields can be focused into a tunnel or, as some of our engineers are calling it, 'slipstream', generating massive changes in the local space curvature. Further advances in these techniques may revolutionise warp drive altogether.

[RA_NAME_ULTRACONDUCTIVITY]
Ultraconductivity

[RA_DESC_ULTRACONDUCTIVITY]
Ultraconductive coils augment the power generated by a starship's warp drive with absorbed energy, effectively reducing the power required to generate a warp field. The energy is absorbed from both electromagnetic and subspace sources.

[RA_NAME_BASIC_CONSTRUCTION]
Basic Construction

[RA_DESC_BASIC_CONSTRUCTION]
Construction technology represents advances in fabrication methods and architectural designs. It influences the production speed of factories as well as the durability of starships.

[RA_NAME_GAMMA_FUSION]
Gamma Fusion

[RA_DESC_GAMMA_FUSION]
Conventional welding methods partially melt the material to be welded; this side effect is unacceptable for advanced spacecraft. Gamma fusion welding bonds materials through nuclear interaction, rather than electromagnetic stimulation, ensuring joins between metal alloys are strong enough to withstand weapon fire and the harsh vacuum of space.

[RA_NAME_INTEGRITY_FIELDS]
Integrity Fields

[RA_DESC_INTEGRITY_FIELDS]
Structural integrity fields allow large structures (such as starships) to be made from heavy materials without suffering the stress caused by the mass of such materials. As a result, stronger alloys may be used in all forms of construction, including the fabrication of various space-frames.

[RA_NAME_EPITAXY]
Epitaxy

[RA_DESC_EPITAXY]
Monomolecular epitaxy allows the construction of material filaments one molecule wide. These filaments can be used independently or combined to make incredibly strong synthetic alloys.

[RA_NAME_PHASE_TRANSITION]
Phase Transition

[RA_DESC_PHASE_TRANSITION]
Phase transition bonding merges two pieces of material by temporarily changing the phase of one item. When the phase distortion is reversed, the two pieces are inextricably merged, and the density of their intersecting volume is doubled.

[RA_NAME_NANOTECH]
Nano-Tech

[RA_DESC_NANOTECH]
Nano-technology is not a new concept in engineering, but recent advances in this field have established astonishing results in nanite AI. It is now possible to engineer the molecular configurations of materials with only small nanite colonies. Their new ability to learn, evolve and self-replicate even, has yielded a new era in the construction of advanced alloys.

[RA_NAME_DIFFUSION_BONDING]
Diffusion Bonding

[RA_DESC_DIFFUSION_BONDING]
Diffusion bonding is an advanced method of phase-transition bonding. With this method, the increased density is diffused over the entire compound rather than concentrated in the intersection volume. This method can also be used to achieve uniform density in complex alloys.

[RA_NAME_DURANIUM_MICROWELDING]
Duranium Microwelding

[RA_DESC_DURANIUM_MICROWELDING]
Duranium is a highly durable metal alloy that is now used in the construction of, amongst other things, starship hulls. But manipulating the highly fused molecular state of duranium alloys is difficult, making it an expensive metal for use in small structures or objects. But the use of duranium alloys in everyday objects is now a reality thanks to advances in micro-welding techniques. Achieving this level of molecular-engineering facilitates the availability of multiple field applications.

[RA_NAME_NUCLEAR_EPITAXY]
Nuclear Epitaxy

[RA_DESC_NUCLEAR_EPITAXY]
Nuclear epitaxy allows solid matter to be constructed at the subatomic level without the large amounts of energy required by transporter-based methods. As a result, the durable materials preferred in large-scale construction are now much more cheaply and readily available.

[RA_NAME_ELECTRON_BONDING]
Electron Bonding

[RA_DESC_ELECTRON_BONDING]
Electron bonding is a sophisticated welding process that excites surface electrons to create strong nuclear bonds without causing any collateral damage or residual heat.

[RA_NAME_ABLATIVE_MATRICES]
Ablative Matrices

[RA_DESC_ABLATIVE_MATRICES]
Ablative matrices compliment the natural hull materials with an ablative matrix that vapourizes upon the impact of enemy weapons fire, thereby dissipating the destructive energy of the impact. This in turn reinforces the overall structural integrity of starships. It is also far easier to remove and replace ablative armour plates than it is to repair damaged hulls, so this technology can potentially reduce the time needed to repair battle-damaged starships.

[RA_NAME_QUANTUM_EPITAXY]
Quantum Epitaxy

[RA_DESC_QUANTUM_EPITAXY]
An advanced form of nuclear epitaxy, quantum epitaxy allows the quantum states of subatomic particles to be adjusted without the energy required by transporter-based methods. Virtually any solid matter can be fabricated by this method.

[RA_NAME_BASIC_WEAPONS]
Basic Weapons

[RA_DESC_BASIC_WEAPONS]
Weapons technology is an applied physical science, primarily concerned with the large scale rapid discharge of destructive energy. Weapons research applies to personnel-scale and starship-scale weaponry.

[RA_NAME_PHASE_MODULATION]
Phase Modulation

[RA_DESC_PHASE_MODULATION]
Advances in phase modulation have allowed us to upgrade current pulse weaponry technology. By modulating the directed-energy particle stream in the emitter chamber, a pulsed protonic charge can be produced, resulting in a phased energy discharge. These 'phasers', as they have come to be known, have a far greater energetic and destructive potential than all previous types of beam weaponry, rendering older technologies utterly obsolete.

[RA_NAME_NADION_COMPRESSION]
Nadion Compression

[RA_DESC_NADION_COMPRESSION]
Experiments with the 'rapid nadion effect' have produced new and more reliable forms of phased energy discharges. Power and pulse frequency can now be compressed and more efficiently channelled - and the more energy channelled into the pre-fire chamber, the greater the percentage of 'nuclear disruption force' applied against the target. This in turn means it is now possible to implement non-lethal settings on beam weapons, or produce weapons with much higher destructive potential without sacrificing safety for the user.

[RA_NAME_PHASE_CONVERGENCE]
Phase Convergence

[RA_DESC_PHASE_CONVERGENCE]
Shield resistance is increased by power, but decreased by impact area. A phaser's nadion flow can be fired in a controlled convergence pattern whose cross-sectional area is vanishingly small at the point of the shield impact. This reduces the effective strength of enemy shields, effectively increasing the impact strength of the phaser.

[RA_NAME_MATTER_PACKETS]
Matter Packets

[RA_DESC_MATTER_PACKETS]
Torpedoes use a supply of matter and antimatter to produce an explosion. Matter packet technology allows the matter and antimatter reagents to be thoroughly mixed before containment is released. This will virtually eliminate reactant wastage, providing a more efficient (and therefore more effective) detonation cycle.

[RA_NAME_MULTIFREQUENCY_BEAMS]
Multifrequency Beams

[RA_DESC_MULTIFREQUENCY_BEAMS]
Shields are least effective when their resonance frequency is the same as the frequency of the incoming beam; this same effect allows our starships to fire through our shields at enemy targets without causing damage to those shields. Multifrequency beams increase the likelihood of such an effect occuring against enemy starships by operating on several simultaneous frequencies. This maximises the probability that part of the beam will match the harmonics of enemy shield systems, therefore inflicting additional shield damage. It is possible that such beams may even bypass enemy shields altogether.

[RA_NAME_SUBSPACE_GUIDANCE]
Subspace Guidance

[RA_DESC_SUBSPACE_GUIDANCE]
Torpedoes that rely on starship tactical data for guidance cannot react as quickly as enemy ships. The development of subspace guidance systems that are small enough to be carried on the torpedo itself eliminates the need for starships to provide tracking and guidance information. Not only does this reduce the effectiveness of enemy sensor-jamming systems, but it allows our torpedoes to autonomously track even rapidly-moving targets.

[RA_NAME_MICROPULSING]
Micropulsing

[RA_DESC_MICROPULSING]
Micropulsed beams are fired in a series of bursts rather than a constant beam. The difference is visually undetectable, but they increase the energy required by resisting shields - thus effectively increasing shield penetration.

[RA_NAME_ANTIMATTER_COMPRESSION]
Antimatter Compression

[RA_DESC_ANTIMATTER_COMPRESSION]
Using a small-scale nonpropulsive warp field, the antimatter load of a torpedo can be micro-compressed, therefore increasing the effective isotonnage of the detonation. It allows the reactive mass to equal the total normal mass of the torpedo.

[RA_NAME_QUANTUM_SHAPING]
Quantum Shaping

[RA_DESC_QUANTUM_SHAPING]
A torpedo detonation sends energy in every direction, and any energy which is not directed at the enemy vessel or its shields is wasted. Quantum shaping is an euphemism for the quantum-mechanical moulding of the torpedo blast, so that all of the energy is directed at the enemy vessel.

[RA_NAME_QUANTUM_RESONANCE]
Quantum Resonance

[RA_DESC_QUANTUM_RESONANCE]
Quantum resonance relies on harnessing the inherent zero-point-energy of matter, increasing the destructive power beyond that attainable by ordinary photon torpedoes. The new and innovative 'quantum torpedo' realises the 'quantum effect', encompassing an energetic local release of the zero-point-energy field. Highly efficient in deployment speed, with onboard propulsion and navigation links, they are capable of producing yields significantly in excess of anything produced before, theoretically being able to produce explosions of up to 450 isotons per casing.

[RA_NAME_ULTRA_EMITTERS]
Ultra Emitters

[RA_DESC_ULTRA_EMITTERS]
By enhancing the charge that passes through them, ultraconductive beam emitters increase the potential energy of beam attacks. These emitters can be installed in personal weapons as easily as starship-grade beams.

[RA_NAME_GRAVIMETRICS]
Gravimetrics

[RA_DESC_GRAVIMETRICS]
Gravimetrics is an advanced field that incorporates and unifies quantum shaping and the 'quantum effect'. Utilizing variable graviton field harmonics, a controlled gravimetric distortion wave is focused along the zero-point-energy event horizon of the quantum torpedo, increasing the energetic release potential.
