              <Description><![CDATA[The Drexoran has answered the call for a long range observation and patrol vehicle – an extension of the intelligence arm in more ways than one. The Drexoran is a small Scout, conceived and designed with the sole purpose of discrete deep space tactical assignments, particularly to sensitive regions where security is paramount, and where early warnings of fleet movements would prove most valuable. A berth on a Scout would be a noble career choice for any officer, as their duties provide an important service for the Union. But it comes at a price, as one is often duty-bound to exile for their numerous extended missions, for Scouts operate best alone, and sometimes far from the comforting sovereignity of Cardassian space. As such, it is a pertinent point to note that Scouts operate a highly sophisticated subspace mapping system, thanks in no small part to careful management of its power reserves. The subspace signatures are also blanketed meticulously – it is a virtue of comparative 'stealth' that grants the Scout a certain flexibility in long-range exercises. But the Drexorans do not excel in battle; they are vulnerable alone, and all commanders should proceed with all due care and wisdom in delegating combat strategy.]]></Description>

This has been addressed with the introduction of its successor: the Komax class. The Komax class Scout is an admirable performer all round, and could be treated almost as a regular Destroyer-type starship, but with the added faculties and properties of the Scout. It is thus not be underestimated, and can at last operate far from the Cardassian border without the need to persistently retreat – its weapons can now deal out as much as it can take, making it an exceedingly valuable addition to the fleet. Military commentators should note that along with increased sensor resolution, the hull armour is immensely strong, and its manoeuvrability is exceptional. The Komax is a prodigious and quite formidable piece of hardware.]]></Description>

But this advantage in weaponry is offset somewhat by a design limitation - a sacrifice that was technically unavoidable, and that is reduced armour, and only standard shielding. The Union starship design specialists have purposefully aimed for an all out fast-assault ship - this is its primary function. But Central Command envisage numerous other roles for the Hideki in the future, notably as a border patrol ship, and in intercepting enemy Scouts, Transports and Colony Ships, but also in protecting vulnerable worlds and trade lanes from enemy raiders. It is also well-suited to conducting raids of its own against poorly-defended systems.]]></Description>

              <Description><![CDATA[The future has arrived at last, in the shape and form of a monster bristling with menace and raw firepower. The Kirol project finally came to fruition, and the result was the Galor class warship; the pride of Cardassia. Its armour is nearly impenetrable, being almost as well protected as some starbases, and, in tandem with the armour, its shields can deflect and absorb an enormous assault. Galor class warships are reserved for the most experienced and competent Guls, who can lead by example and, if required, coordinate the strategic battle plans of an entire fleet.]]></Description>

              <Description><![CDATA[The Irkon class shares similar technological advances to the design themes of the Kirol, and is actually an extension of that successful project. The Irkon employs the same design and technical specifications as the Kirol - but on a far larger scale. A specialised reciprocating fusion reactor provides not only added durability to the shields, but extended functionality at high warp velocities, whilst also supplementing the enormous power requirements for its deadly weapons systems. ]]></Description>

              <Description><![CDATA[The Keldon class is the final payoff from many years of research in starship construction, resulting in the successful deployments of both the Kirol and the Galor classes. This awesome vessel is truly armed to the teeth. It is the ultimate weapon for long-range assault and fleet command in major battlegroups. Its ablative shield-spread guards a complement of the deadliest torpedoes, but the Keldon's basic design is still not well-suited for close-range fighting, and suffers the similar manoeuvrability problem that earlier designs have suffered. However, it is safely assumed that few potential foes will survive long enough to discover this weakness and take full advantage of it. This one handicap is offset by the clear benefit of aft-firing torpedoes, which will often prove to be a rare and valuable commodity in a crowded skirmish. ]]></Description>

              <Description><![CDATA[Size can often disturb your enemy as much as the actual power one has to wield. The Monak class is powerful indeed, the greatest mobile assault force that our science can muster. But added to that is the simple and brutal intimidation factor. The power requirements to sustain this beast are immense, and whereas any potential enemy is often crushed without a trace, the Monak must endure appalling manoeuvrability and limited warp speeds. But it hardly matters, just one of these lethal ships on the field of battle will ensure high morale amongst the troops, and eventual victory for Cardassia.]]></Description>

An offshoot of the Monak that came before it, the Koronak sets new standards in both daring and excellence; it is guaranteed to survive simply by its sheer firepower. If any fleet goes to battle with a Koronak as its spearhead, the troops know that the very best that Cardassia has to offer leads them.]]></Description>

The Quebec is a fully self-sustaining starship in itself, with many automated systems. It is capable of leading deep space colonial convoys for several years with no need to re-supply. Like the Edwards predecessor the Quebecs come fully equipped to rapidly and efficiently terraform and settle almost any class of planet. With legal restrictions of the highly unstable protomatter matrix, new advances in biotech have developed the CABET terraforming system (Cellular Auto-Biogenic Eco-Transmogrification). This effectively reduces terraforming yet further, quickly making even the most hostile planet habitable. Also, new Geo-Form reactors stored onboard can be utilized to tap geo thermal energy directly from the planet's mantle, boosting available energy for the power-intensive terraforming process. Extended internal volume of the Quebecs cater for more colonists per vessel than ever before.]]></Description>

The durability of the Oberth surprised many, and although it performed admirably throughout its long life, the Nova class is a much warranted addition to the fleet in these changing times. Rather than design an entirely new class, ASDB specialists requisitioned the Defiant-class pathfinder vessel; by replacing the heavy weaponry with the most advanced multi-spectral sensor palettes, the weapon handling equipment and torpedo magazines with cutting edge science laboratories, and the overpowered reactor with the most efficient available, the Nova class has become the absolute antithesis of the Defiant project. These changes supplement the already impressive research capacities. Blended with both speed and endurance, it grants the Nova the forerunning position in new exploration efforts. The Nova class promises to be the torchbearer for scientific and planetary research and charting moving far into the next century.]]></Description>

Starfleet's designation of Frigate is in essence a 'Destroyer-type', smaller than a capital Cruiser but with a large arsenal for defensive purposes. Power reserves of Frigates are geared towards speed and agility, enhanced by the light space frame. In tight combat scenarios the Daedalus is an ideal proponent of launching fast attacks, and in such encounters with multi-ship taskforces they would come into their own, manoeuvring quickly whilst flanking the larger Cruisers to lay down cover fire.]]></Description>

              <Description><![CDATA[Young minds, new ideas. This is the thinking behind the latest in starship innovation. Hailed as 'The Great Experiment', the Excelsior is the most profound and far-reaching speculation yet for starship design. Utilizing new theories in warp studies, transwarp was greeted with great excitement and expectation, but the Excelsiors' field tests failed to win over the top brass. But it was not a total loss, and research continues. The Excelsior spaceframe itself is tremendously capable, housing many laboratories, medical facilities, and diplomatic accommodations, as well as room for major evacuations and transport scenarios, all in a package that provides both mobility and strong defensive weaponry. Traditional - but cutting edge - warp systems will now be installed in all future Excelsiors while transwarp research continues. Equipped with these systems, the Excelsior class will enter full production to undertake Starfleet's next great experiment: test bed of the Explorer design concept. For the first time in fifty years, the Federation has a true multi-role starship, and has taken the Constitution concept even further.]]></Description>

              <Description><![CDATA[Initially designated 'Platform SV-65', the Advanced Starship Design Bureau has finally completed the project that has become the Intrepid class - a highly advanced starship in all areas. It was not intended to be the largest or indeed the most powerful of ships, but it is highly resilient. The prototype was also a 'guinea-pig' for a speculative replacement for Isolinear Optical Chips: a type of Bio-neural organic gel pack unit, designed to relay and process computer information at phenominally high speeds. Tests have shown that this experimental replacement of the data network allows the Intrepid to react in a fraction of the time than is possible via more traditional optical data networks, but the technology is yet to be proven in the field; time will tell whether the system is as practical and resilient as the traditional data networks that Starfleet has been using for decades. The Intrepid is a medium-sized Cruiser that is capable of both exploration and intermediate-term scientific studies, and her design also offers several important advantages over existing designs in the fleet; her retractable nacelles and variable geometry warp field operates without the detrimental effects of traditional warp drive, and this advance also grants the Intrepid great speed. If needed, the ship can supplement the very swiftest of rapid response forces with her surprisingly effective tactical systems.]]></Description>

Most noticeably, the Nebula is equipped with a modular, swappable missions pod that can augment sensors, carry cargo and supplies, diplomatic quarters and limited tactical systems. With this level of versatility, the Nebula promises to become the mainstay of Starfleet in the future, both in supporting roles of the new generation of starships and on solo missions where her own impressive capabilities will be indispensable.]]></Description>

Although deadly in small taskforces, they are also greatly effective when leading a group of lesser Cruisers into battle. Like her namesake, the Prometheus represents an advance that will take the Federation so far into the future her significance is difficult to comprehend now. Designed purely for the defence of the Federation's interests, the Prometheus combines manoeuvrability, speed, durability and raw firepower in the most modern package imaginable. Heavily automated, the Prometheus requires but a fraction of the normal crew complement of a starship her size, and her pioneering Multi-Vector Assault Mode allows her to split into three separate, powerful ship sections, exposing even more of her potent weaponry to her target, while at the same time, dividing the enemy's firepower three ways. All three sections can operate for short periods independently, and all are highly manoeuvrable. The mere thought that a Prometheus class starship might be brought to bear will deter all but the most determined of threats, and Prometheus's visionary tactical abilities will ensure the survival of the Federation against even the most serious of these threats. The commanders of even the strongest of enemy ships will bear no shame in retreating before this monster.]]></Description>

The few systems which cannot be constructed by replicator are scavenged from the construction ship's hull, and the crew then transfers to station duty.]]></Description>

Secondly, a very important function has been designed into the Vralnath, and that is to administer rapid and large scale evacuations. Even in the worst case scenario, citizens of the Romulan Star Empire are not expendable resources.]]></Description>

Propulsion breakthroughs have granted engineers the means to install the D'Renet with latest in impulse drive innovations, which grants it improved agility and power preservation.

Critically, the D'Renet possesses a cloaking capability, that is thought will confound even the most vigilant of enemy sensors – it may even succeed in penetrating enemy borders undetected.

Should a D'Renet be discovered and engaged its defensive arsenal would be no match for a powerful adversary: flight rather than fight is as always the prudent tactic.]]></Description>

It is equipped with an enhanced propulsion system; a noticeable improvement, it will be seen in close quarters combat, or at high warp. In tandem with its sophisticated cloaking system its shields are also more durable, and can now absorb a bombardment that would dismantle those of ships from previous generations. With these enhancements and additions the D'Rakor will still of course excel in its scientific role, and promises to be over all an outstanding asset for many years to come.]]></Description>

It will be the Scout's task to scout and patrol the borders and sensitive regions for fleet movements and the military activity of rival powers. Of particular concern to the hierarchy is the protection of (and early warning to) outlying colonies and starbases, and the security of Neutral Zone territory. The Scout's critical strength is high resolution sensors with a multi-spectral deep scan capacity, and because their power consumption is not geared to weapons or shields it can conduct these operations vigilantly and indefinitely. But the penalty is a general combat weakness, and battle should always be avoided if at all possible. All commanders should be reminded that a Scout's chief defence and protection is stealth, and not weapons.]]></Description>

Whether or not the cloaking systems of the R'Mor were flawed, or too many commanders were guilty of over-extending the ship's capability, the truth may never be established – the point is moot, but it is expediently addressed in this upgrade. The cloaking device has been enhanced, and streamlined to offset the extreme power demands. The result being an increased energy reserve available for improved tactical effectiveness. Now, should the need arise, D'Kor crews will discover that they are more than capable of fending off an attack, at the very least.]]></Description>

              <Description><![CDATA[There have been a number of key technological advances during the service life of the D'Kor class, and so varied and so important have they been that it warranted a successor. The R'Kovar class is that successor, and it is aptly timed. Of particular significance is the improved cloaking system. A groundbreaking construct has been devised involving a new form of scattering field, which employs a nutation variance that it is believed no known sensor technology can penetrate. The potential importance of this tactical improvement can be scarcely measured, if it proves to be as effective in reality as it has been in field trials. This breakthrough may well prove to be the tipping point in a precariously balanced galactic situation. We may even see a time in the not too distant future when our long range Scout Ships can pass, undetected and unchallenged, into enemy territory and beyond.]]></Description>

As part of a combined fast response taskforce, a Heavy Destroyer unit would be unrivalled in its ability to detect and intercept an incursion threat.]]></Description>

              <Description><![CDATA[Sheer size is often simply the manifestation of power. And there can be no doubt that size, and the cosmetic design of a starship, can send a powerful message to an enemy. The Imperial Fleet now possesses a formidable spearhead, in the shape of the first true, dedicated warship. The purpose of a Cruiser is to facilitate a variety of important fleet functions, notably defence, exploration, and patrolling at great range: in effect a multirole vessel as durable and versatile as it is valuable.The D'Ridrex promises to be an exceptional asset in research, discovery, and security, and a formidable opponent in battle.]]></Description>

              <Description><![CDATA[The now aging D'Ridrex promised, and delivered. It was a critical success in ensuring the current security of Romulan borders; and the defence of its citizens and the prosperity of the economy. But grave times call for bold measures, and it is time for the introduction of its logical replacement. The D'Renedex is that replacement, and a necessary one in light of technological evolution. With recent innovations in particle physics scientists have developed a broad scan sensor cluster capable of probing many layers of subspace simultaneously. And coupled with a significantly improved power feed configuration for primary disruptors and a sophisticated target-seek guidance system for plasma weapons, the D'Renedex class Cruiser, as a multi-role vessel, threatens to make all other ships in present day service redundant.]]></Description>

              <Description><![CDATA[The R'Derex takes a bold step forward in warship research and design, focusing predominantly on weapons configurations. Power generation and efficiency has been readdressed in the R'Derex, so that the cloaking device is not so dependant on reserves that could otherwise be used for vital tactical systems. The long term projections for this new breed of powerful Cruiser reach far beyond the bounds of her contemporaries; it is a benchmark design that seeks to assert a common standard, in which Romulan superiority in this quadrant of the galaxy is wholly and emphatically demonstrated. ]]></Description>

              <Description><![CDATA[The D'Bora is a modelled embodiment of excellence over all Cruiser-types that have ever come before it. It follows the traditional design lineage of its predecessors, but exceeds them in the grandiose presence it certainly exerts. Internally the very latest in scientific and engineering mastery is to be witnessed in what is undoubtedly the most advanced warship the Star Empire has ever produced. The pioneering originality that was put to task in the revolutionary D'Drexon Battlehawk has been modernized and streamlined in this, the current pinnacle of Romulan technology. It may be some years yet before it is eclipsed, or even matched.]]></Description>

Against her multiple rivals the Romulan Star Empire must, at the very least, compete, if not triumph outright. It is for this objective that the Battlehawk Strike Cruiser is realised; for why have less when you can have more? The R'Tan is simply that, the conceptualization of a larger, more powerful type of Cruiser, with weapons systems comparable to her contemporaries, but in greater number. Its every system is optimized for the singular purpose of dominating battle.]]></Description>

From the initial design phase the goal was to pack its defensive arsenal with the latest in engineering sophistication, and so bring to the battle the most up to date scientific and technological prowess Romulus has to offer. The D'Drexon's advanced warheads deliver more damage than ever witnessed before, and it is also equipped with a completely overhauled guidance system, whose accuracy maximizes targeting efficiency.]]></Description>

Its predecessors will never be forgotten, and may yet continue to serve in a lesser capacity. But for sheer power and superiority in one overwhelming package, the D'Idricon is the champion of all Romulan Cruisers. Equipped with the strongest shields and heaviest torpedoes and disruptors available, it is fully capable of engaging and destroying multiple enemy vessels.
