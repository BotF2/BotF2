Honoring Birth of the Federation, more commonly abbreviated 'BOTF', was a turn-based empire-building game played within a randomly generated galaxy. This ensured no two games would be exactly alike. Players could select from one of five major empires and compete with the other four for galactic domination. These empires were the United Federation of Planets, the Klingon Empire, the Romulan Star Empire, the Cardassian Union and the Ferengi Alliance. The game was set in the Next Generation era of the Star Trek Universe. The galaxy was laid out in numbered square sectors many of which contained solar systems inhabited by minor races and alien entities. The galaxy also contained other stellar bodies including nebulae and wormholes. Players could take a chance and enter a wormhole that would either jump them to a distant sector of the galaxy or destroy their ship. Empires expanded by the terraforming and colonization of planets combined with diplomatic annexation or military conquest of minor races. Planetary systems could also be forcibly captured from other major empires. Play involved exploration and diplomacy to establish strategic alliances, intelligence operations, technological development and turn based combat with vessels of rival empires. Exploration was aided by player-built outposts and star bases that supported expansion into distant space. Random events, such as Borg invasions, presented additional challenges for players. There was also a multiplayer option. In either single or multi player mode, unclaimed empires and minor races were handled by an artificial intelligence system within the program.

## Setup
This project is in C#.  The code is on Github, but many of the graphics are stored separately, due to their size, on a shared dropbox folder.  You can email me, sisko52744 at gmail dot com, for access to that folder.  You will need to copy the contents of a resources folder there into a resources folder on your local computer. 

For the project, we recommend using a good IDE, such as Visual Studio or VSCode for this project.  You will need to download an older .NET framework for this project, found here:

You will also need to download an XNA Framework, found here:

## Contributing
There are many ways you can contribute. Since you're on GitHub, we'll assume you're a programmer. BotF2 follows a fairly standard development process -  fork, branch, commit, pull request, merge. If you don't know how to do this, here is a guide to the process - https://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/01/27/using-fork-branch-git-workflow/
